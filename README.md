# Time Series Analysis of Air Pollution Data

## Problem Statement:
Analysing the time series data of pollutants' concentrations of Singrauli Coalfield to find blasting time and trends among the data.



The air pollution data set was obtained from the Singrauli Coalfield Pollution Control Board for coal Indiaâ€™s (Singrauli Coalfield). The pollution was monitored during open-pit blasting. There are 13 columns overall in the air pollution data collection of pollutants that are available at intervals of 15 minutes.

The project is divided into following parts:

1. Data Exploratory Analysis(Exploring the data)  
2. Forecasting (Prediction of data from historical data using methods like ARIMA)  
3. AQI Calculation and Prediction (Comparison Between ARIMA, Random Forest, GRU, LSTM )
4. Finding blasting time and relevant analysis  
5. Curve Fitting  
6. Trends, Seasonality, Descriptive, Explanatory Analysis
